#  Testing Framework for Unikraft Builds

A modular and extensible Python-based testing framework for validating Unikraft unikernel builds across various configurations, platforms, and environments. This tool is designed to be seamlessly integrated into the CI/CD pipelines of the Unikraft ecosystem.

##  Overview

This project aims to:

- Automate configuration, building, and testing of Unikraft unikernels.
- Support a wide range of configuration options: VMMs, hypervisors, architectures, and boot protocols.
- Integrate tightly with the `catalog` and `catalog-core` repositories.
- Run as part of Unikraftâ€™s CI/CD workflows to validate pull requests automatically.
